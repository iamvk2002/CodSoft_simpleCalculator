# Simple Calculator using C++

## Description

This is a simple command-line calculator implemented in C++. The calculator allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two operands, and then displays the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

   ```
   g++ simple_calculator.cpp -o simple_calculator
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```
   ./simple_calculator
   ```

5. The calculator will prompt you to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).

6. Enter the two operands you want to perform the operation on.

7. The program will execute the selected arithmetic operation and display the result.

## Sample Usage

```
Enter operator: +, -, *, /: *
Enter two operands: 10 5
10 * 5 = 50
```

```
Enter operator: +, -, *, /: /
Enter two operands: 20 4
20 / 4 = 5
```
